      <div class="savings-bar-content">
        <p>
          &emsp;Welcome to the Savings Planner, your visual companion on your
          financial journey towards achieving your goals.
        </p>

        <h2>How the Savings Bar Works</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;The Savings Bar is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you
          stay motivated while saving for your financial goals. Here's how it
          works:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Set a savings goal and specify the target amount you want to
            achieve.
          </li>
          <li>
            As you save money over time, update the progress by entering the
            amount saved.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Savings Bar will display a progress bar, showing you how close
            you are to reaching your goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay committed and watch the progress bar fill up as you get closer
            to your target.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Add Multiple Savings Goals</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;We understand that you might have multiple financial goals.
          That's why we've made it easy for you to add and track multiple goals
          simultaneously. Simply click the plus button to add a new savings
          goal. Each goal will have its own progress bar, helping you visualize
          your progress towards different aspirations.
        </p>
